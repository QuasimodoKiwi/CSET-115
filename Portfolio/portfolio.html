                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>I began to code with Python in 2019. During that year,
                        I showed interest in programming 
                        when I first heard of a computer programming class that I would soon take 
                        in my sophomore year.
                        I have kept my interest since then, and I still consider myself a novice programmer
                        due to self-recognized goals that involve areas of improvement with coding languages.</p>
